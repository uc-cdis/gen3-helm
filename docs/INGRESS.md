# Ingress in Gen3

# Dev
if `global.dev` is set to true, a very basic ingress is created.

# AWS

if `global.aws.` is set to true, there is a special ingress resource that will be created, that has prepoulated annotations for the `alb-controller` to create an alb with similar settings as `cloud-automation`.

# Custom Ingress

There is a custom ingress that can be deployed and manipulated. This is a default helm ingress resource, and can be enabled using values like the ones below: 


```
revproxy:
  ingress:
    # Enable the custom ingress resource included by helm. Add any configurations as needed.
    enabled: true
    # Any annotations that needs to be passed to the ingress resource
    annotations:
    hosts:
    # Replace with your hostname
    - host: qureshi.planx-pla.net
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: Prefix
    tls:
      # this is the secret generated by the cert and key from global.tls
      # if you have your own secret, reference that. 
      - secretName: gen3-certs
        hosts:
        # Replace with your hostname
          - qureshi.planx-pla.net
```
