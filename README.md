# gen3-helm
Helm charts for deploying Gen3 services to a kubernetes cluster.


# Deployment inststructions

TL;DR 
```
helm repo add gen3 http://helm.gen3.org
helm upgrade --install gen3  -f ./values.yaml 
```

Use the following as a template for your `values.yaml` file 

You can set the postgres passwords to be what you want, if you leave them blank, they will be autogenerated for you. 

```
global:
  hostname: localhost
  postgres:
    host: postgres-postgresql.postgres.svc.cluster.local
    master:
      username: postgres
      password: 
      port: 5432

arborist:
  postgres:
    password: test

audit:
  postgres:
    password: test

fence: 
  postgres:
    password: test
  FENCE_CONFIG:
    OPENID_CONNECT:
      google:
        client_id: ""
        client_secret: ""

indexd:
  postgres:
    password: test

manifestservice: 
  postgres:
    password: test

metadata: 
  postgres:
    password: test

peregrine: 
  postgres:

pidgin:

```


## Prerequisites

### Kubernetes cluster
Any kubernetes cluster _should_ work. We are testing with EKS, AKS, GKE and Rancher Desktop. 

It is suggested to use [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) as Kubernetes on your laptop, especially on M1 Mac's. You also get ingress and other benefits out of the box. 

### Postgres 
We need a postgres database. For development clusters you can deploy the postgres helm chart using the following commands: 

```
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install postgres bitnami/postgresql -n postgres --create-namespace
```

This will setup a postgres instance in a namespace called `postgres` 

For production installations use a managed postgres service. 


### Login Options
Gen3 does not have any IDP, but can integrate with many. We will cover Google login here, but refer to the fence documentation for additional options. 
#### Google login

You need to set up a google credential for google login as that's the default enabled option in fence. 


The following steps explain how to create credentials for your gen3

Go to the [Credentials page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).

Click Create credentials > OAuth client ID.

Select the Web application application type.
Name your OAuth 2.0 client and click Create.

For `Authorized Javascript Origins` add `https://localhost`

For `"Authorized redirect URIs"` add  `https://localhost/user/login/google/login/` 

After configuration is complete, take note of the client ID that was created. You will need the client ID and client secret to complete the next steps. 


# Production Deployment
These helm charts are not yet ready for production, but check back again soon.
