# This one needs some explanation. As far as we can tell, on AWS, other network policies allow traffic to reach the 
# Kubernetes API. If you're running in another env (such as a local deployment), you'll need this policy to allow access
# to the API server, without knowing ahead of time what the IP address is (since selectors won't work)
