## 1. Gen3 on Helm

[Gen3 on Helm](https://github.com/uc-cdis/gen3-helm) is the new preferred way to run a Gen3 commons on a single laptop, desktop, or VM. Using Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes, Gen3 can be installed against any cluster, including a local one such as Minikube or Rancher Desktop.

This option is suitable for those that wish to experiment with Gen3, develop against it on their machines, or other non-production uses. At this time, the Helm deployment is not considered production-ready.
